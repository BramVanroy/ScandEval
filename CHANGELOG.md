## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Reduces batch size if CUDA runs out of memory during evaluation


## [v0.3.0] - 2021-08-10
### Changed
- The `W036` warning message from SpaCy is no longer shown.

### Fixed
- Raise `InvalidBenchmark` if model cannot be loaded from the HuggingFace Hub.


## [v0.2.0] - 2021-08-09
### Added
- Added the part-of-speech tagging task from the Danish Dependency Treebank.
  Can be loaded with `load_ddt_pos` and used in `Benchmark` as `ddt-pos`.
- Added the dependency parsing task from the Danish Dependency Treebank.
  Can be loaded with `load_ddt_ddt` and used in `Benchmark` as `ddt-dep`.
- Documentation section and link to `README`
- The `Benchmark` class and the CLI now accepts a `batch_size` argument

### Changed
- `Benchmark` arguments `languages`, `tasks`, `model_ids` and `datasets` have
  been renamed to `language`, `task`, `model_id` and `dataset`, to keep it
  consistent with the CLI.
- When loading datasets, these will now be four dictionaries instead of lists,
  to allow for distinguishing features and labels.
- `batch_size` arguments can now only be among 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32, and the
  corresponding gradient accumulation will be set to 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1,
  respectively. This is to ensure that all finetuning is done using the same
  effective batch size, to ensure fair comparisons.
- Batch sizes are automatically halved if the GPU runs out of memory, with
  gradient accumulation correspondingly doubles.
- Evaluation of `SpaCy` models on token classification tasks are more accurate.

### Fixed
- `README` typos fixed, and image renders correctly


## [v0.1.0] - 2021-08-05
### Added
- First beta release
- Features Danish sentiment, hate speech detection and named entitity
  recognition datasets for benchmarking
